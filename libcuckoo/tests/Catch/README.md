## What's the Catch?

Catch stands for C++ Automated Test Cases in Headers and is a multi-paradigm automated test framework for C++ and Objective-C (and, maybe, C). It is implemented entirely in a set of header files, but is packaged up as a single header for extra convenience.

## How to use it
This documentation comprises these three parts:

* [Why do we need yet another C++ Test Framework?](docs/why-catch.md)
* [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md) - getting started
* [Reference section](docs/Readme.md) - all the details
